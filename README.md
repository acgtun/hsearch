Protein motifs are conserved fragments occurred frequently in protein sequences. 

They have significant functions, such as active site of an enzyme. 

Search and clustering protein sequence motifs are computational intensive. 

HSEARCH converts fixed length protein sequences to data points in high dimensional space, and applies locality-sensitive hashing to fast search homologous protein sequences for a motif. 

HSEARCH is significantly faster than the brute force algorithm for protein motif finding and achieves high accuracy for protein motif clustering.
